<p align="center"> I live in Colorado where the weather seems to change every 15 minutes and it can take your attitude from a soaring high, playing outdoor games in the beautiful sun and warmth, to dismal and agravating low as the wind, rain, and possible snow come out of nowhere to freeze out your hopes and dreams.
<br>
<p align="center">Weather-TUDE pulls in data from the OpenWeather API to get the weather data of whichever city the user puts in and gives the user up-to-date weather with a little attitude, so they (hopefully) know what to expect...maybe.

### Challenges & Reflections: <a name="challenges"></a>
* This is my first solo-project after graduating the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.edu/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz9ieBhCIARIsACB0oGKG2l2iJY1j7t81uU6Pn6dJqdD3gi0m_QfV66vrhnGg4r7xgsv--RkaAuzSEALw_wcB).
* It was great putting the skills I learned to use, and also implementing some new ones, like creating custom hooks and having them work! 

<br>

### Future Iterations: <a name="future"></a>
* Display the high and low temp for each day in the 5-Day Forecast.
* Create an external link to the National Weather Service, or similar site for further satellite weather details.
