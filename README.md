<p align="center"> I live in Colorado where the weather seems to change every 15 minutes and can take your attitude from a soaring highs while you enjoy the sun, to dismal and agravating lows as the wind, rain, and possible snow come out of nowhere to freeze out your hopes and dreams. So, since the weather has attitude, why not your weather app???</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Weather-TUDE pulls in data from the OpenWeather API to get the current weather & five-day forecast data of a city the user inputs and delivers the weather with a little slice of attitude.</p>

### How To Use: <a name="how"></a>

**For the casual user:**
* Please visit my app [Weather-TUDE](https://weather-tude.vercel.app/)!
* Type in a city into the input and weather details will be shown for that city.

<br>

**For the developers out there:**
* `Fork` this repository and `Clone` it down to your local machine
* `cd` into the repository
* Once in the repository, run `npm install`
* After installation, run `npm start`
* The app should now open up on your default browser with the URL `http://localhost:3000`
* You're now ready to move through the app!

### Challenges & Reflections: <a name="challenges"></a>
* This is my first side-project after graduating the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.edu/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz9ieBhCIARIsACB0oGKG2l2iJY1j7t81uU6Pn6dJqdD3gi0m_QfV66vrhnGg4r7xgsv--RkaAuzSEALw_wcB).
* It was great putting the skills I learned to use, and also implementing some new ones, like creating custom hooks and having them work! 

<br>

### Future Iterations: <a name="future"></a>
* Display the high and low temp for each day in the 5-Day Forecast.
* Create an external link to the National Weather Service, or similar site for further satellite weather details.
* Improving responsiveness
* Implementing TypeScript
